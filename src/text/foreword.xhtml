	The following is the foreword for the story in the April 1928 edition of <i>Amazing Stories</i>, written by the editor, <cite>Hugo Gernsback</cite>:

<blockquote id="original-foreword">
	<p>
		<span class="first-words">Our</span> readers will remember the author of this story as the third prize winner in our $500.00 contest last year.
		Here again Mrs. Harris shows her versatility by delving into the future and striking a novel chord.
		Insects were, and still are, man’s greatest enemies, and will remain so for many years to come.
		There is no telling that insects might not come into ascendency once more at any time.
		The picture that the author draws here, therefore, is certainly not too far fetched or impossible; perhaps it is not even improbable.

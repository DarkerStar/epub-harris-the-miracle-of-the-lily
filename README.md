"The Miracle of the Lily" by Clare Winger Harris EPUB ebook
===========================================================


"The Miracle of the Lily" was originally published in April 1928, on pages 48 to
55 of Astounding Stories Volume 3 Number 1, edited by Hugo Gernsback. It is a
perfect example of cracking good "scientifiction" - as science fiction was
called back then - with a classic golden age twist near the ending.

Clare Winger Harris (1891-1963) was not the first woman to publish science
fiction in the American pulp magazines, but she was the first to publish under
her own name. She was one one of the best science fiction writers of the 1920s.
